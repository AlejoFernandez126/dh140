### About me

-The main subjects for this repository contain a description of myself, a description of the course, project ideas, and my objective for this class.Topics.Resources

Hello world. My name is Alejo, I am a senior at the University of California, Los Angeles majoring in Philosophy and minorning in Digital Humanities. 

My academic interest in Philosphy differ from one-another. I have interest in all fields of Philsophy epseically in Metaphysics, Ethics, and Epistology. 

If you are interested in finding interesting reads or want to know what the mumbo jumbo above is referring to, then follow the links below which will redirect you to a brief history of the subject or a literature piece on the subject.

-The type of project ideas I have for this course are directly related to my interest in sports ad entertainment. As a Profesional race car driver I have a deeper understanding in the comoplexities invovled in motorposrts. As a philospher I have gained insight and tools to deliver my understanding of all of the different ingredients needed to go fast around a track. This course is the stepping stone in being able to digitalize information i want to propose to the world as well as a way to research and compile that information. For exmaple I would like to begin a commentary Youtube channel in whihc I analyze race events and other type of motorsport activities. Based on the research that demonstrates what are the most popoular videos in motorposrts on Youtube then I'll have a starting pooint as to what type of videos I should analize first.
