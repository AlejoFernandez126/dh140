Hello world. My name is Alejo, I am a senior at the University of California, Los Angeles majoring in Philosophy and minorning in Digital Humanities. 
My academic interest in Philosphy when talking about metaphycsics have to do with free will and determinism,in ethics it has to do with moral obligations and their limits. In epistolomy my interest have to do with what is know as the mind-body problem.
