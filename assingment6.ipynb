Our waiter, Alexis, was friendly and helpful and funny- he also set up the outside heater next to our table so we were extra comfortable. We had the truffle and cheese tasting menu, and it was AMAZING!! My favorite was pasta #1. This may seem expensive, but it's totally worth it- you get an appetizer, three half servings (so basically 1.5 pastas) and a dessert.

We also ordered the broccolini which was SO good!!The one thing I will say though, is their pastas are pretty salty like others said. The cacio e pepe was over the top salty due to wayyy overload of pecorino. The manager came around asking how everything was and when we told him about the cacio e pepe, he gladly took care of it and helped us exchange it for the lasagna instead. The service and how he took care of us was super appreciative. I definitely want to come back and try all of the other pastas on the menu! A true 5 star restaurant.\"\n",

On top of that, I just loved their noodles. It's freshly made and the flavor was amazing. We decided to sit outside because it was a beautiful day. We were greeted by the owner/ manager.

Yellowtail Crudo - Fresh, tender, perfectly dressed yellowtail Tagliatelle in truffle sauce: Perfect tagliatelle in a fragrant and light truffle sauce. The simplicity allows both the truffle and pasta to shine. Pomodoro: The tomato sauce is so deceptively simple, but so good. Cacio e Pepe: Thicker pasta with a nice balance of pepper and cheese. Tiramisu al cucchiaio: I was blown away by how amazing and different this tiramisu was! This is not your typical soaked ladyfinger tiramisu, but rather a custard and nutella type of tiramisu.The al fresco dining was simply perfect for all the dishes, as was the service!\"\n",

The al-dente texture and perfectly coated truffle butter made this pasta incredibly aromatic and so so memorable. Even with the shared appetizer and dessert, I felt full after having three sampler pasta dishes, all unique in its own way. Even though they didn't have any ciabatta, focaccia, or any bread whatsoever, I didn't feel that there was anything lacking because their pasta alone was phenomenal and they truly maintain the quality of their dishes. Pasta is daily imported from Italy, and I am thrilled to have access to all three Uovo locations within driving distance: Santa Monica, Wilshire, and Marina Del Rey. Next time, I will try their butter truffle tagliatelle with mushrooms as well as their ragu. See you again very soon, Uovo!\"\n",

All staff wears mask Food: the noodles were cooked well and flavor for all the pasta was pretty delicious. I like how there were different options from meaty, more cheese flavor, to not heavy cheese. Which is nice since I'm not super into cheese Tiramisu wasn't my favorite. It was in a small cup and it felt more like a liquid pudding. Personally I would pass on that hence a star off. It just felt meh and not worth the price Service: Our server was excellent at clearing out any empty plates we had. He checked in on our and gave good recommendations for pasta so that was awesome. I wish I remembered his name but it was kind of loud Inside but we sat right by the bathroom and back kitchen corner booth table. At there 8.14.21 party of 4 at 6:45pm seat time.

They don't take reservations, but when we came at 6 that night, we were able to be seated immediately. The staff were friendly and welcoming. At the time we came, we had the option of both indoor and outdoor dining. The menu is not extensive. They have options for both pasta tasting or a la carte. Prices are on the lower side, around $15 for most pastas. The food was served not long after ordering. My friend had the carbonara and I had the arrabbiata. We also shared the cauliflower. My friend liked her dish but remarked that it was heavy and filling. I liked my arrabbiata but would have preferred if the texture was a bit more al dente. It also wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be. I'd probably come back if I'm looking for a casual dining experience but I think there are better options on the west side.\"\n",

    "After reviewing the scores I infer that Vader scores can be accurate, however due to the complexities of language and typos from user errors this also creates inaacuarte results. One reason I mention this is becuase if we look at the first score, (.4939) which was from a 5 star review. Lets compare that to another 5-star reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "   --After making the comparison, the first score was signigifiantly lower than the following 5-star review. This made me want to analize the text and i think the difference in the score is a result of what the first review user input for the review. It seems like its a typo and the type of slang used in the first review tha makes the score drop even though in context its should be a similar score to the other 5-star reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "A further analsyis demosntrates that Vader can misinterpret langauge by misinterpreting capitlization and punctaution for words that may not seem usual to a sentiment analizer. For example, I arranged the reviews from 5 - 1 star so i was assuming that i would see the scores represent the star reviews. a 5 star review should hvae. ahigher pos score and compound socre than a 4,3,2,1 star review. This was not the result that Vader scores created. I noticed that the 5,4,3,2 star reviews had a similar and high compound score. When inspectiving the pos scores there does seem to be regressive trend which shows me that Vader is doing a good job correlating the pos score and the star review. Furthermore, the neg score was interesting to notice since it does seem to show an accurate correlation between a high neg score a lower star review, but it was odd to see three individual reviews recieve a 0.0 neg score yet their neu scores were not similar. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Vader can be a great tool to analyze sentiment in text, it seems to lean on the postive side if there is a trend. For best results clean the text that you want to analize prior to pasting the text to be analized."

I expected it to be a predictable, typical rom-com following the same tropes and beats and in some ways it was but there was something so tender about it that couldn't categorize it into those endlessly factory-made films with no heart. I may be exaggerating but I liked the film more than I thought I'd do. And it's particularly because of the amazing cast. It has Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Bradley Cooper and Christopher Walken, among others. What more do you need. Walken and Vaughn were very good here. Funny and a pleasure to watch while Owen Wilson did a pretty good job holding everything together. Rachel McAdams is great in this. And this maybe because I just love her. She is charming, cute, gracious and gorgeous. And all of this is enough for me to fall in love with her as Wilson did. Some of the jokes don't fit in quite well, some land well but largely it's an enjoyable affair. And don't let anybody tell you any different. Yes, it's cliché but only because it's supposed to be. It has to be. Don't let anybody fool you because that is what you want to see. A light and fun romantic comedy which is perhaps predictable but, you know, it's part of the deal, it's what you sign up for and yes there are instances of films where no compromise is needed to be made but those are very rare.

However, I hadn't seen a Korean film since a long time, and once I heard all the good things about Parasite and the amount of acclaim it has earned, I couldn't stop myself from watching it. And whoever said it slowly transforms into something unexpected, wasn't kidding at all! Parasite started as a drama with shades of dark humor, before morphing into an edge of the seat thriller that keeps you captivated and shocks you to the extent that you can't even move. It's that spellbinding.The film can't be easily put into one genre, and that's true. Still, whether you like black comedies/dramas/thrillers or not, you must see this film at least once. It's just that you need to prepare yourself to be shocked because once the surprises start coming, you can't forget any of that for a long time. Parasite runs a little more than 2 hours but is so captivating that it might feel like the shortest 2 hours of all time.Words won't be sufficient to further describe this film's actual brilliance. I'm still spellbound. What started like a fun movie became something so surprising that it was hard to forget after it ended. It took away the very feel of watching a film. Whatever I saw just felt real, absolutely real. No doubt, Parasite is one of the most original films you'll see in the recent memory, and surprisingly has elements of almost every genre covered in its entire duration. Let's hope it wins big at the Oscars too!\"\n",

Everything in this film,is perfect. And that is among many of the positives of the movie. The movie is quite complex and layered much more than one may think it to be. The story of the family mixed with different genres and sub-genres such as comedy,thriller,suspense,horror is done seamlessly and quite brilliantly such that it feels earned. The shift in the quirky fun heist comedy to horrific edge of the seat thriller is the highlight of the film. There is meaning conveyed in almost every scene,every shot constructed with such precision with much deeper layers into it connected throughout the film,for instance, the Native American reference or the line that Mr. Park crosses that urges Mr. Kim to take such a sudden and extreme action. I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone but after watching this movie I'm deadly serious that there's nothing in this film that doesn't add to the narrative of the film. This is a black comedy that goes from being very funny to nerve-wracking within seconds that is endlessly entertaining and at the same time very thoughtful about it's themes about class divide,guilt,redemption and truth. Such films don't come very often and this movie proves why Bong Joon-ho is one of the best filmmakers working today.\"\n",

However, I will say it is interesting that the creators allowed the viewer to see it from different perspectives. As many other reviews took the parasite title to mean the capitalist the simple rich people etc. I saw a bunch of unemployed con artists sucking up as much free internet, food etc. reap what they sowed. I would say my peers would describe me as a progressive democrat and I believe Capitalism has done more harm for many people and great things for a few lucky people, so I just think it's crazy as someone who grew up poor in public housing with nothing can see it an entirely different way. As for the acting, I mean I was doing a lot of reading so it's hard to gauge it but I would say it was bad at all. I don't mind reading subtitles I put them on a lot anyway but I feel like that would be the biggest reason why people wouldn't watch. I think anyone that wants to enjoy a good movie should give it a chance. There was a couple of jaw dropping moments and a crazy plot twist.\"\n",

The satire was effective and it was an entertaining film, but maybe because I am Filipino, there's a factor of already being “numbed” by poverty porn. We've had “Insiang”, the recent Mendoza films, various indie films tackling poverty with almost equally promising wit, satire and dark humour such as but not limited to “Ang Babae sa Septic Tank” plus almost all other indie films, lol. But then again, I think the power of Parasite is contained in the title itself. It works its way through your subconscious like a parasite, feeding on your deepest and darkest secrets, regrets, guilt and sins, not only as an individual but as a part of this mammothic gyrations of economic and social strata. It's power is in subtlety, in the nuanced story-telling, in the layered metaphors painted through clever visual dance, in putting the gray areas of class divide onto a pedestal, flesh and blood and then making you stab it in the heart, but it cuts deeper because in the end, you realize it's a magic mirror and you are holding your own lacerated heart.\"\n",

This felt like a screwball comedy from the 1940s crossed with a dark art film from the 1970s. I saw 1917 a few days earlier and was captivated beginning to end and stunned by the cinematography that made it feel like it was done in one take in real time (ie original). Parasite was boring and tedious. I even felt the acting was blade, like a budget tv show. The most well done part of Parasite was the little pyjama sex scene, but I can't see myself remembering this film for anything else. Good heavens....\""

    "The two topics that the model chooses to recommend based uponnelting a moview that is a comedy and another that is a drama. An interesting point to observe is that while the genre for each movie is disticnt the recomendations dont seem to see such a split between the two genres. For exmaple, both topics provide,film, movi, yet the comedy movie doesnt five comedi as a reccomendation, it seems like it was analized as a romantic comedy. Furthermore,they also share common root words yet can give different meanings. For example: the first topic includes the verbs \" watch, say, see, thought, want. The second topic has: \"saw, watch, still,start\" This demonstrates how there isnt a clear cut separation betweemn the two films and their topics/reviews."
